# StockPrice-Prediction-using-RNN-GRU
Predicting the stock prices using RNN GRU

In this problem, we are considering the 'trainset' dataset for doing the time-series analysis. 

## Problem Statement:

We are given stock price in trainset dataset from 01/2013 to 12/2017. 

The task is to predict the trend of the stock price for the year 2017 by using the trained model which has been trained on the datapoints upto year 2016.


## Details:

In this problem for building the time-series model (considered the stock prices upto 2016 year) & predicting the stock prices for the year 2017, considered the time-step of 60.

Trainset dataset splitted into --> training data & test data

'Train data' is used for training the model by using the stock prices upto year 2016 & 'test data' used for predicting the stock prices for the year 2017

Training data has 1008 records & test data has 251 records


## Tasks performed:

a) Understanding the problem

b) Collecting the data

c) Data preprocessing

d) Build Model using RNN & Grated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

e) Training the dataset

f) Predict


## Dataset Description:

The dataset consists of 1259 records with 7 columns

## Topics Covered:

a) MinMaxScaling

b) Plotting of time series data using Matplotlib

c) Splitting of Train & test in time series analysis

d) Data preprocessing required for the time-series analysis using RNN model

e) Building of RNN GRU model

d) Prediction of stock prices
